#### User Interaction
1. **User Input:**
   - The user visits the Brief Generator Website and enters the parameters required to generate a brief using AI.

#### Backend Processing
2. **Website to Backend Communication:**
   - The website collects the user's input and sends a request to the Brief Generator API in the backend.

3. **Backend Request Handling:**
   - The backend receives the request and processes it by wrapping the user's parameters in a Langchain block, a specific data structure used for processing.

4. **Database Interaction:**
   - The request details are saved to a MongoDB database for record-keeping and tracking.

5. **AI Model Interaction:**
   - The backend then sends the Langchain block to the Gemini AI Model for processing.
   - The Gemini AI Model generates a response based on the input parameters.

6. **Response Handling:**
   - The Gemini AI Model sends the response back to the Langchain component, which then wraps the response in an output structure.
   - This structured response is sent back to the backend.

7. **Storing the Response:**
   - The backend saves the response from the Gemini AI Model into the MongoDB database.

8. **Website Response:**
   - The backend sends the final response back to the website, which then displays the generated brief to the user.

#### Optional Email Export
9. **Email Export Option:**
   - If the user opts to export the brief via email:
     - The website requests the user's email address.
     - The user enters their email address on the website.

10. **Backend Email Handling:**
    - The website sends the response ID and the user's email address to the backend.
    - The backend sends this information to the Zoho Email Service to send the email.

11. **Email Confirmation:**
    - The Zoho Email Service sends the email.
    - The backend confirms that the email has been sent and informs the website.
    - The website notifies the user that the email has been sent.

#### Process End
- If the user does not opt to export the brief via email, the process simply ends after displaying the brief to the user.
